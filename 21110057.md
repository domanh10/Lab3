# Lab 3: Firewall#
# Task (packet filter with iptables):
## a. Setup rules on router to block all access into it except ping.
First we need to open the terminal in the exercise folder named firewall.

Command `docker-compose -d` is used to start and run containers defined in the file

then we use the `docker ps` command to see all currently running docker containers

Next access the router container with the following command `docker exec -it router /bin/bash`

Delete all previously setup rules in the router then check the router rules. To do that, we use the following commands:

`iptables -F` Delete all rules except user-defined

`iptables -S` Check rules and their order on router.

`iptables -X` Delete all user-defined rules

The goal is to block all incoming packets. While the current configuration with DROP for INPUT rules achieves this, the command would be necessary if the default INPUT policy were ACCEPT. we need to use the following command `iptables -P INPUT DROP`

Ensure the highest priority rule `-P INPUT DROP` is placed at the beginning of your firewall rule list. This prioritizes blocking all incoming traffic by default. Subsequently, add a rule using the following command to allow ping traffic specifically: `iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT`

Next, we need to open another terminal to access to **'outsider'** virtual computer with command `docker exec -it outsider-10.9.0.5 /bin/bash`

Then try ping to router with command  `ping 10.9.0.254`

<img width="726" alt="lab 3 5.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/770359d2-eb07-4e4a-b0dc-845d89fd1254"><br>

It shows a notification line `2 packets transmitted, 2 receive, 0 packet lost` ==> Ping traffic still works

Try telnet to router with command  `telnet 10.9.0.254`

<img width="726" alt="lab 3 6.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fb9e528-0c44-422a-8613-97251d847eb5"><br>

It shows a notification line `Unable to connect to remote host` ==> Block the access to router from outsider computer

Try curl to router with command  `curl http://10.9.0.254`

<img width="726" alt="lab 3 7.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a4401f0-a133-4020-bed6-e85b2af8d311"><br>

The result is that nothing comes out ==> curl has also been blocked

## b. Setup rules on router to prevent computers on subnet 10.9.0.0/24 from accessing the internal web server (iweb).
First we need set more rules to prevent htttps, https port from computers on subnet **'10.9.0.0/24'**. To do that, we need to use the following command:

This command uses for blocking http port (80): `iptables -A FORWARD -s 10.9.0.0/24 -d 172.16.10.110 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP`

This command uses for blocking https port (443): `iptables -A FORWARD -s 10.9.0.0/24 -d 172.16.10.110 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP` 

Next, we need to open another terminal to access to **'outsider'** virtual computer with command `docker exec -it outsider-10.9.0.5 /bin/bash`

Try curl to iweb with command  `curl http://127.16.10.110`

<img width="726" alt="lab 3 8.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09ea650b-0d92-4c7c-9799-b4a6944e9009"><br>

It shows a notification line `Failed to connect to 172.16.10.110 port 80` ==> Access is blocked.

## c. The badsite was found to contain malwares and source of delivering bots. Setup rules on router to stop computers on subnet 172.16.10.0/24 from accessing the badsite
First we need set more rules to prevent htttps, https port from computers on subnet **'172.16.10.0/24'**. To do that, we need to use the following command:

This command uses for blocking http port (80): `iptables -A FORWARD -s 127.16.10.0/24 -d 10.9.0.10 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP`

This command uses for blocking https port (443): `iptables -A FORWARD -s 127.16.10.0/24 -d 10.9.0.10 -p tcp --dport 443 -j DROP`

Next, we need to open another terminal to access to **'inner'** virtual computer with command `docker exec -it inner-172.16.10.100 /bin/bash`

Try curl to get html file from badsite 10.9.0.10 with command  `curl http://10.9.0.10`

It shows a notification line `Failed to connect to 10.9.00.10 port 80` ==> Access is blocked.
